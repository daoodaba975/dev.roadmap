# 2023 Dev Roadmap

My development roadmap for year `2023` 🚀  
The objective is to gain new skills and develop my expertise on technologies that I already master.

## PocketBase 📦

I've used PocketBase 2/3 times, and honestly, it's great as a tool. I love it. I'm even adding it to my stack now.

## Playwright ⚗️

It really wasn't on the agenda, but I discovered Playwright. It's like Selenium, which I had used once, but I find it better. It's super intuitive and cool to write tests with.

### So finally 🤔

This year, I didn't invest the time I wanted to learn and explore, but I maximized on the technologies I tested.
