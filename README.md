# 2024 Dev Roadmap

My development roadmap for year `2024` 🚀  
The objective is to gain new skills and develop my expertise on technologies that I already master.

## Ruby On Rails 💎

Back to relearn with the goal of integrating it into my stack permanently.

## Rust ⚙️

I've heard a lot about this language; it will probably be my discovery of the year. I'll take the opportunity to have some fun with it.

## PNPM 🧩

I've always been tempted, but due to laziness, I never had the time to test it. This time, I'll use it in a few projects and see the difference compared to what I usually use (NPM & Yarn).
