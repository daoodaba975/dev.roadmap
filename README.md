# 2024 Dev Roadmap

My development roadmap for year `2024` 🚀  
The objective is to gain new skills and develop my expertise on technologies that I already master.

## Ruby On Rails 💎

I spent time exploring some RoR documentation, videos, and articles. To be honest, I didn’t invest enough effort, but since I already have a solid foundation in this technology, I plan to move on to practical applications, perhaps by working on a few projects in 2025.

## Rust ⚙️

That said, my biggest disappointment this year is that I didn’t find time to dive into the Rust programming language. However, I’m determined to give it a try in the coming year.

## So finally 🤔

Overall, 2024 wasn’t a remarkable year in terms of achieving my goals. For 2025, I intend to revisit and refine my past objectives.
