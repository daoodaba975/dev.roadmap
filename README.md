# 2025 Dev Roadmap

My development roadmap for year `2025` 🚀  
The objective is to gain new skills and develop my expertise on technologies that I already master.

## Rust ⚙️

Rust was on my learning list for 2024, but I couldn't dedicate time to it. This year, I really plan to get into it.

## Data Science 🧮

Thanks to the partnership between the Galsen DEV community and DataCamp, I’m becoming increasingly drawn to data science. It’s a field in which I currently have no knowledge, but I fully intend to take this opportunity to get started.
